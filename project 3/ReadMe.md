The third project in Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learing by Lasse Totland, Domantas Sakalys, Synne Mo Sandnes, and Semya A. TÃ¸nnessen. 

## Abstract 
XXX: Insert abstract from pdf here 

## Dependencies 
Requires python3 
Check your version by running 
``` python3 --version ``` 

The project makes use of the following libraries: 
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `time`
- `seaborn`
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`
- `keras`

## Running the code 
Run all code from the folder `src`. 

The output is generated by running the following codes from your terminal: 
- `code to run to reproduce results`

The output from the bonus task (bias-variance analysis) can be run from the same folder in your terminal using: 
- `bonus/biasvar_analysis.py`
Note that the program takes a bit of time to run. 

## Contents 
### data
Folder that contains various files that are called in the notebooks and python scripts.

### Figures 
Folder containing results produced, as well as a subfolder `bonus` containing the figures for the bias-variance analysis. 

### src 
Folder that contains the codes used to produce results, as well as a subfolder `bonus` containing the codes for the bias-variance analysis. 

- `Dataprep_A.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that covers our data preparation with pandas, incl. correlation analysis and feature extraction.
- `Random_Forest_Analysis.ipynb`: Notebook displaying the development of a boosted random forest model for predicting heart disease diagnosis using scikit learn functionalities.

## Tests 
No tests have been made for the core, but it was last ran with the operating system `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS`.
