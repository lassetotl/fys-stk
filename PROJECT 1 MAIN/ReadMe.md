All finished code used to answer the tasks + the final report (pdf and .tex) is posted in this folder. 
The names of the jupyter notebook .ipynb files refer to the tasks they answer (ex. Franke_OLS_BCD.ipynb).

The plots in the notebooks are from the last runs of the scripts, the figures in the report describe 
what parameters were used to generate them (nr. of points, kfolds, noise etc.).
